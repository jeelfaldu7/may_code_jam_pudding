        "Wikipedia is one of the most widely used information platforms in the world, offering free access to knowledge on nearly every imaginable topic. One of the reasons it is so widely used is that anyone can contribute to it, and thus making it knowledge accessible, but also introduces challenges. Since so many different people contribute, it is easy for bias to slip into articles.\n",
        "\n",
        "While Wikipedia does have policies to outright information, it is harder to catch and correct subtle bias in the way information is written. Thus, in reality language can reflect personal opinions, cultural viewpoints, or even political leanings. These influences can affect how information is presented, which might shape how readers understand a topic.\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of this project is to inverstigate and quantify this bias. Through a combination of data collection, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and supervised learning techniques, we aim to build a model capable of identifying biased language in Wikipedia articles - mostly at the sentence level. This will get us an overall 'bias score' for an article, offering a scalable and interpretable way to assess objectivity."

        "In this part, we conducted a thorough preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to prepare the dataset for bias detection modeling. Firstly, we reviewed the dataset's structure, identifying the number of rows and columns, and inspecting its basic information and summary statistics. We then addressed data quality issues, including duplicates, and handling missing values. Doing this, there were no duplicates found in the data, while missing values were found in two columns 'news_link' and 'type' in negligible percentage of the dataset. Thus, rows will missing values were dropped.\n",

        "Next, we focused on cleaning and standarizing the text data. This included lowercasing, removing URLs, special characters, and stopwords, as well as lemmatizing words to reduce them to their root forms. These steps help normalize the text and reduce noise, which is essential for any NLP-based modeling.\n",
        "\n",
        "To better analyze bias, we created a binary label column ('is_biased') to distinguish between biased and unbiased texts. This will serve as our target variable in supervised which will be used as input features for further linguistic anaylsis and model training.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the dataset is now well-structured, cleaned, and ready for feature extraction, model building, and further investigation into biased language patterns."

'Trump presidency' and 'white nationalism' have the highest average bias rates, with over 70% of sentences labeled as biased. These findings suggest that politically and socially charged topics are more prone to emotionally loaded language. On the other hand, topics like 'immigration', 'universal healthercare', and 'gun control' show lower bias rates, though they still remain near 45-50%, indicating that even these texts are not free from bias.\n",

        "The graph above analyzes the sentiment polarity across biased and unbiased text of different articles. It reveals that while both categories generally maintain fa neutral tone on average, biased articles tend to exhibit a wider range of sentiment. This includes a higher frequency of strongly positive or negative sentiment, indicating that biased writing often uses more emotionally charge language. In contrast, unbiased texts shows a tighter sentiment distribution, reflecting a more balanced and objective tone. This suggests that sentiment polarity can serve as a useful signal in detecting bias, particularly when combined with other linguistic and contextual features."

        "The bar graph displays the average proportion of biased sentences per article across different news outlets. The data suggests that media outlets vary widely in how frequently they use biased language. Alternet and Federalist have the highest average bias scores, suggesting strong ideological framing. Breitbart and HuffPost also show high bias, while MSNBC and Fox News despite opposing views - have similar moderate scores.Reuters and USA Today stand out for their low bias, reflecting more neutral reporting. Overall, outlets with a strong ideological orientation tend to have higher bias scores, whereas mainstream or centrist outlets tend to score lower. In particular, Reuters stands out for having the most neutral tone in its reporting."
